# Hi there, I'm FeoLED 👋

I'm a student learning the foundations of web development through any free resource I can find. My journey is driven by curiosity and a love for practical projects that serve their purpose!

## 🛠️ Skills & Technologies
- **HTML**
- **CSS**
- **JavaScript** (with DOM manipulation)

## 🚀 Favorite Projects
- **Space-themed Landing Page**  
  Created as part of The Odin Project curriculum, this landing page is mostly CSS and lets me explore creative web design with a space vibe.
- **Rock-Scissors-Paper Game**  
  A simple interactive game where I manipulate DOM elements with JavaScript—fun, functional, and a great learning experience.

## 📚 Learning Journey & Goals
- I enjoy building projects that work and meet their goals, no matter the size.
- While there are many frameworks out there, I plan to learn **React** soon as part of my upcoming courses.
- My biggest goal is to understand **servers, backend development**, and how information is handled behind the scenes.

## 🔒 Interests Beyond Web Dev
- Deeply interested in **infrastructure** and **cybersecurity**. I’m always learning new terms, measurements, and concepts in cybersecurity.
- My current computer isn’t strong enough for heavy programs, so I focus on web development until I can afford a machine that can handle more advanced cybersec tools.
